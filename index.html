			<p class="excerpt">Hello, I am Kevin, a french developer. I have been programming
				for more than 10 years. I'm a curious person by nature and very
				interest to everything that have a relation with a computer. In a
				single word, I'm a fucking geek. With the years passing, my knowledge
				become quite vaste. I started as a frontend developer, change to a
				backend developer and now I am a mix between backend developer and
				System Administrator. My story started from my bed room as a kid with
				the very basic and classic HTLM/CSS. But now, I am quite armed !</p>
